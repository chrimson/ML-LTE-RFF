<h2>Abstract</h2>
Should include objectives, methods, key findings, and conclusions.<br/>
Brief summary of the project (150-200 words). 175:<p/>

This is a study of creating a proof-of-concept system that recognizes RF fingerprints (RFF) extracted from LTE user equipment (UE) uplinks with a web service.
It required researching properties of the LTE standard, and generating random UE uplink signals each with a sample set of minor variances exhibiting a characteristic RFF.
A machine learning neural network was built from the dataset of UE signals and their variances, into which a simulated test target LTE waveform with RFF would be applied.
From this simulation, attributes for a feasible fingerprint were determined for then building a system to test and demonstrate.
The service is able to accept a submitted LTE compliant uplink signal with an unknown RFF embedded, than compare its likeness to waveforms already in the dataset.
The system decides whether to update its dataset or flag the submitted signal, depending on if the RFF in question strengthens evidence of matching or identities conflict.
Finally, these decisions will be discussed and analyzed.


<h2>Introduction</h2>
Background and Context: Overview of the problem or topic.<br/>
Objective(s): Clear definition of what the project aims to achieve.<br/>
Scope: Define the boundaries of the work.<br/>
Significance: Why the project is important, particularly in the field of Wireless Network Security.<p/>

When a device attempts to connect to a base station, it needs to be authenticated. LTE increases the complexity for authentication due to necessary standards.
There are an increasing number of ways to spoof device MAC address, IP address or other identifying information.
With Radio Frequency (RF) Fingerprinting, a unique signal impairment emitted by the device exists due to imperfections in the hardware when it is created.
The specific device attempting to connect to the base station can be determined, and authenticating with RF fingerprint can be quick and secure.
No method to spoof a RF fingerprint is currently known to exist, thus allowing each device to be cataloged and identified off this attribute.<p/>

With the introduction of radio fingerprinting in [2], we are able to use machine learning models and software defined radio frequencies to give each device,
although similar in nature, a specific RF fingerprint.
It is mentioned in [2] that “No higher level decoding, feature engineering, or protocol knowledge is needed, further mitigating challenges of ID spoofing
and coexistence of multiple protocols in a shared spectrum” which would allow the protocols to be further strengthened in other directions.
Instead of having overlapping protocols for authentication, there is the possibility of a single authentication method based off the RF fingerprint,
further reducing the overhead cost of authentication in each protocol.
One significant finding in this paper is that they have tested it at specific directions, notably ranging from 2 feet away to 50 feet away.
It is also mentioned that the identification remains accurate until it drops off after 34 feet.</p>

In [1], the authors use RF fingerprinting on a variety of devices from different manufacturers and find that detecting and authenticating a user based on
their RF fingerprint is a valid control.
With the authors implementing their scenario in 4G-LTE, it gives precedence for our development also centered in LTE.
There is a brief mention in the future work of the paper about how degradation can occur over the course of the hardware’s lifetime.
This could potentially cause it to no longer have the same fingerprint, or possibly emulate a similar fingerprint of another device.
Additionally, there is no note of intentional disruption of the hardware, potentially changing the fingerprint of the device.<p/>

    <h3>Generation of Sample Dataset</h3>
    MATLAB CLI script to generate LTE compliant modulated uplink waveform which will include RF fingerprint (RFF) simulating device (UE) connection to Evolved Node Base (eNB base station)<br/>
    Before demodulation, apply filters and OFDM to extract RFF<br/>
    After demodulation eNB will also retrieve UE parameters (genuine, cloned or spoofed) like MAC<br/>
    GNU Radio collect RFF Signal Metadata Format (sigMF)<p/>

    Simulated RF Fingerprints (RFF) are generated by random parameters (that are likely unique) of a sine and cosine combination.
    Their effect on the base Reference Measurement Channel (RMC) waveform generated by LTE ToolBox is then the RFF Waveforms (RWF).
    They can be illustrated on the MATLAB GUI by uncommenting plot, timescopes and spectrum analyzers with and without the RFFs applied.

    <h3>Building Neural Network</h3>
    TensorFlow to apply RFF against Convolutional Neural Network, authenticating RFF, comparing to stored UE, classifying indications<p/>

    RWFs are applied to build the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

    <h3>Testing Sample Waveform Prediction</h3>
    A set of RWF characteristic parameters from ue_rwf_parms.asc may be chosen for variables A, B, C, D, J and K and passed into the MATLAB script.
    Then this step will generate a target variant RWF with marginal deviations.
    Take note of the UE's associated MAC address, but observe that NO definite MAC address will be passed into the next step
    (just the label encoding of all MAC addresses)<p/>

    Model predicts the target RWF, decodes its associated label and finds the corresponding probability<p/>

    (caveats: truncated at 5000 vs 307200, simulated fingerprint to sin/cos)

    <h3>Integrating Components for Service System</h3>

    Copy generated RFF Waveforms (RWF) from the dataset of s1_LTE_RWF_dataset.m.
    Optionally copy saved model and encoded labels from s2_BuildTrainCNN.py if you don't want to wait for servive to rebuild Keras neural network<p/>

    Launch service in one terminal. In a different terminal, copy RWFs to staging directory, play with different MAC addresses, etc. Observe flag directory.
    Observe service operations in the first terminal.
