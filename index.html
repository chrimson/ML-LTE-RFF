<h2>Abstract</h2>
Brief summary of the project (150-200 words).<br/>
Should include objectives, methods, key findings, and conclusions.<br/>
This is a study of creating a proof-of-concept system that recognizes RF fingerprints extracted from LTE user equipment with an HTTP service.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Background and Context: Overview of the problem or topic.<br/>
Objective(s): Clear definition of what the project aims to achieve.<br/>
Scope: Define the boundaries of the work.<br/>
Significance: Why the project is important, particularly in the field of Wireless Network Security.<br/>
(structure of report)

<h2>Literature Review</h2>
Summary of Related Work: Brief discussion of existing solutions, methodologies, or studies.<br/>
Gaps Identified: What gaps or challenges in the literature does your project address?<br/>
(includes generation by MATLAB, building neural network, testing the sample prediction)

<h2>Methodology</h2>
Approach and Framework: Describe the methodology used to tackle the problem.</br>
Tools and Technologies: List and explain any software, hardware, or frameworks utilized.</br>
Data Sources: Mention any datasets, simulations, or experimental setups.</br>

<h3>Generation of Sample Dataset</h3>
MATLAB CLI script to generate LTE compliant modulated uplink waveform which will include RF fingerprint (RFF) simulating device (UE) connection to Evolved Node Base (eNB base station)</br>
Before demodulation, apply filters and OFDM to extract RFF</br>
After demodulation eNB will also retrieve UE parameters (genuine, cloned or spoofed) like MAC</br>
GNU Radio collect RFF Signal Metadata Format (sigMF)

<h3>Building Neural Network</h3>
TensorFlow to apply RFF against Convolutional Neural Network, authenticating RFF, comparing to stored UE, classifying indications

<h3>Testing Sample Waveform Prediction</h3>
(caveats: truncated at 5000 vs 307200, simulated fingerprint to sin/cos)

<h2>Implementation</h2>
(graph shows different variances for one waveform, how two fingerprints may differ yet exhibit the same frequency spectrum, tried different values of repetitive and strength ranges)</br>

<h3>Experimentation</h3>

<h3>Case 1</h3>

<h3>Case 2</h3>

<h3>Case 3</h3>

<h3>Results for Most Ideal Generation Parameters</h3>
(table, 25 x 20)

<h3>Service System</h3>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
(put the python code together, dataset reader, builder, predictor)

<h3>Four Use Cases of Predictions</h3>

<h3>Trial</h3>

<h3>Observations</h3>

<h2>Results and Analysis</h2>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<h3>Future Work</h3>
Real HW SDR experimentation, no truncation, "catastrophic forgetting"

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
(social, legal implications)
