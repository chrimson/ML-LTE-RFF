    <h3>Generation of Sample Dataset</h3>
    MATLAB CLI script to generate LTE compliant modulated uplink waveform which will include RF fingerprint (RFF) simulating device (UE) connection to Evolved Node Base (eNB base station)<br/>
    Before demodulation, apply filters and OFDM to extract RFF<br/>
    After demodulation eNB will also retrieve UE parameters (genuine, cloned or spoofed) like MAC<br/>
    GNU Radio collect RFF Signal Metadata Format (sigMF)

    <h3>Building Neural Network</h3>
    TensorFlow to apply RFF against Convolutional Neural Network, authenticating RFF, comparing to stored UE, classifying indications

    <h3>Testing Sample Waveform Prediction</h3>
    (caveats: truncated at 5000 vs 307200, simulated fingerprint to sin/cos)

    <h3>Integrating Components for Service System</h3>
    TensorFlow to apply RFF against Convolutional Neural Network, authenticating RFF, comparing to stored UE, classifying indications
