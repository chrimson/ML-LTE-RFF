# RF Fingerprint Matching

Steps 1 and 3 use MATLAB to generate LTE waveforms for simulation and test. Steps 2 and 4 use Python to build the neural network, and test a case against it. Python is used so that the ML power of open-sourced TensorFlow can be harnessed

&nbsp;

__s1_LTE_RWF_dataset.m__ Simulated RF Fingerprints (RFF) are generated by random parameters (that are likely unique) of a sine and cosine combination. Their effect on the base Reference Measurement Channel (RMC) waveform generated by LTE ToolBox is then the RFF Waveforms (RWF). They can be illustrated on the MATLAB GUI by uncommenting plot, timescopes and spectrum analyzers with and without the RFFs applied

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repetitive factor of sine and cosine combination (e.g. 25)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength percentage of RF Fingerprint (e.g. 15)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*25x15_ue_rwf_data* Dataset directory of different devices given by MAC addresses, each with RWFs in numerically named files  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*25x15_ue_rwf_parms.asc* Dataset's MAC addresses and the associated characteristic parameters for their RWF

&nbsp;

__s2_BuildTrainCNN.py__ RWFs are applied to build the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repetitive factor of sine and cosine combination (e.g. 25)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength percentage of RF Fingerprint (e.g. 15)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*25x15_rwf_cnn.keras* CNN built from the RWF dataset by Keras API for TensorFlow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*25x15_rwf_cnn_norm.asc* Normalization factor of CNN  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*25x15_mac_label_enc.pkl* MAC labels encoded to numerical representation needed by the CNN

&nbsp;

__s3_LTE_RWF_test.m__ A set of RWF characteristic parameters from *ue_rwf_parms.asc* may be chosen for variables A, B, C, D, J and K and passed into the MATLAB script. Then this step will generate a target variant RWF with marginal deviations. Take note of the UE's associated MAC address, but observe that NO definite MAC address will be passed into the next step (just the label encoding of all MAC addresses)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repetitive factor of sine and cosine combination (e.g. 25)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength percentage of RF Fingerprint (e.g. 15)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameters of test RF Fingerprint (use format similar to *ue_rwf_parms.asc*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*25x15_target_rwf.asc* Target RWF that may differ slightly from one in the RWF CNN

&nbsp;

__s4_MatchUEbyRWF.py__ Model predicts the target RWF, decodes its associated label and finds the corresponding probability

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repetitive factor of sine and cosine combination (e.g. 25)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength percentage of RF Fingerprint (e.g. 15)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns the MAC address of the UE that most closely matches its RWF to the test target and the confidence of its answer

## Notes
  
Numbered scripts may be used to invoke steps  
./1.sh 25 15  
./2.sh 25 15  
./3.sh 25 15 1.285475e-02 1.464078e-02 5.640578e-03 1.332074e-02 1.405434e-01 4.589930e-02  
./4.sh 25 15

Nested loops that test a range of repetitive factors by a range of strengths  
./all.sh

Truncating is necessary due to limits of CPU and memory

## To Do

Capture MATLAB graphs

Update and retrain model
