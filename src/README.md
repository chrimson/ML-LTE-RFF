# RF Fingerprint Matching

__s1_LTE_RWF_dataset.m__ Simulated RF Fingerprints (RFF) are generated by random parameters (that are likely unique) of a sine and cosine combination. Their effect on the base Reference Measurement Channel (RMC) waveform generated by LTE ToolBox is then the RFF Waveforms (RWF). They can be illustrated on the MATLAB GUI by uncommenting plot, timescopes and spectrum analyzers with and without the RFFs applied

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*ue_rwf_data* Dataset directory of different devices given by MAC addresses, each with RWFs in numerically named files  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*ue_rwf_parms.asc* Dataset's MAC addresses and the associated characteristic parameters for their RWF

&nbsp;

__s2_BuildTrainCNN.py__ RWFs are applied to build the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*rwf_cnn.keras* CNN built from the RWF dataset by Keras API for TensorFlow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*mac_label_enc.pkl* MAC labels encoded to numerical representation needed by the CNN

&nbsp;

__s3_LTE_RWF_test.m__ A set of RWF characteristic parameters from *ue_rwf_parms.asc* may be chosen for variables A, B, C, D, J and K and edited from default in the MATLAB script. Then this step will generate a target variant RWF with marginal deviations. Take note of the UE's associated MAC address, but observe that NO definite MAC address will be passed into the next step

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*target_rwf.asc* Target RWF that may differ slightly from one in the RWF CNN

&nbsp;

__s4_MatchUEbyRWF.py__ Model predicts the target RWF, decodes its associated label and finds the corresponding probability

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns the MAC address of the UE that most closely matches its RWF to the test target and the confidence of its answer

&nbsp;
  
Numbered scripts may be used to invoke steps  
./1.sh  
./2.sh  
./3.sh  
./4.sh

## To Do

Capture MATLAB graphs

Update and retrain model

Refrain from truncating

Restore applicable impairments

## Notes

Assumes every UE has the same base RMC with no deviation
