# RF Fingerprint Matchingr

o1_LTE_RFF_dataset.m - RF Fingerprints (RFF) are simulaed by random parameters (that are likely unique) of a sin and cos combination. Their effect on the basie RMC waveform can be verified by uncommenting plot, timescopes and spectrum analyzers

o2_BuildTrainCNN.py - For now, only RFF is applied to build neural network, not complex-valued waveforms generated by LTE ToolBox

o3_LTE_RFF_test.m - Choose a set of RFF base parameters from ue_rff_parms.asc for variables A, B, C, D, J and K. Step will generate a target RFF with the default tolerances. Take note of the UE's MAC address. The committed example is BB-69-etc... It will not be passed into the next step

o4_MatchUEbyRFF.py - Returns a MAC address whose RFF matches very well

Numbered scripts may be used to invoke steps

./1.sh  
./2.sh  
./3.sh  
./4.sh

## To Do

Base neural network on full waveform and RFF

Refrain from truncating
