# RF Fingerprint Matching

s1_LTE_RFF_dataset.m - Simulated RF Fingerprints (RFF) are generated by random parameters (that are likely unique) of a sin and cos combination. Their effect on the base RMC waveform can be verified on the MATLAB GUI by uncommenting plot, timescopes and spectrum analyzers with and without the RFFs applied

s2_BuildTrainCNN.py - Waveforms generated by LTE ToolBox with complex-values and affected by their RFF are applied to build convolutional neural network (CNN)

s3_LTE_RFF_test.m - Choose a set of RFF base parameters from ue_rff_parms.asc for variables A, B, C, D, J and K. Then this step will generate a target waveform with marginal deviations. Take note of the UE's MAC address. NO definite MAC address will be passed into the next step

s4_MatchUEbyRFF.py - Returns the MAC address of the UE that has the closest matching waveform affected by RFF to the test target

Numbered scripts may be used to invoke steps  
./1.sh  
./2.sh  
./3.sh  
./4.sh

## To Do

Refrain from truncating

Restore applicable impairments

## Notes

Assumes every UE has the same base RMC with no deviation

LTE_Uplinj_RMC.m is for reference only
